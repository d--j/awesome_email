Learn how to use it below.

h2. Introduction

Have you ever tried sending HTML emails to your users? If you did, you know for sure that it sucks big time: none of the usual ActionView helpers want to work, URL routing is disabled, layouts don't work, and last but not least, the CSS you wrote for your email "simply won't work in any e-mail client":http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/01/10/microsoft-breaks-html-email-rendering-in-outlook except maybe Apple Mail. To solve all of the above problems, the <code>awesome_email</code> plugin comes to the rescue. Just install it into your <code>vendor/plugins</code> folder, and the rest comes by itself.

h2. What does it do?

There are a few interesting components in <code>awesome_email</code>:

* The HTML Mail's CSS is automatcally inlined. That means that your designer and/or CSS guy can design the email in a web browser without worrying about how it might look like in excotic email clients. Yes, it works in Outlook, too, and no, it "doesn't work in Outlook 2007 without tweaking":http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/01/10/microsoft-breaks-html-email-rendering-in-outlook. The reason is a "stupid decision from Microsoft about Outlook 2007", but we're working on that one.
* ConvertEntities replaces Umlauts and other crazy symbols like &auml;, &Ouml; etc. with their HTML Entitiy counterparts e.g. <code>&amp;auml;</code> and so on.
* HelperMethods allow you to dump the content of the CSS file right into a style tag inside the header of your HTML mail.

h2. How to use it

In your Mailer.delivery_xxx methods you can use

<pre><code>
    layout    "template_filename"
    css       "css_filename"
</code></pre>

or without letter template

<pre><code>
    css "css_filename"
    html_content = "some html here"
    body(inline(html_content))
</code></pre>

You can include several css files if required

<pre><code>
    css       ["css_filename1", "css_filename2"]
</code></pre>

to define which layout should be used and which css file should be used to create inline styles

h3. CSS inlining

The cummulated style of each DOM element will be set as an style attribute when using css inlining.

h4. Example

  your css file:
<pre><code>
    #some-id { font-size:2em; }
    .some-class { color:red; }
</code></pre>

  your template:
<pre><code>
    <p id="some-id" class="some-class">Hello World!</p>
</code></pre>
  
  will result in the following code:
<pre><code>
    <p id="some-id" class="some-class" style="color:red; font-size:2em;">Hello World!</p>
</code></pre>

h2. Important!

Be sure to follow these simple conventions or otherwise awesome_emails's magic will fail:

* If you send mutlipart mails, check out the conventions on how to name your files: "http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html":http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html So if you have these files inside of <code>/app/views/{mailer_name}</code>: <code>signup_notification.text.plain.erb</code>, <code>signup_notification.text.html.erb</code> ActionMailer will send a multipart mail with two parts: <code>text/plain</code> and <code>text/html</code>
* Your CSS file must be inside of <code>/public/stylesheets</code>
* Your layout files must be inside <code>/app/views/layout</code>

If you use something like "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ to generate your CSS files (and you should!) you can tell awsome_email by overwriting <code>ActionMailer::InlineStyles#maybe_generate_css_file</code>

Here is an overwrite that works for Sass:
<pre><code>
ActionMailer::InlineStyles.module_eval do
  def self.maybe_generate_css_file(file_name)
    Sass::Plugin.check_for_updates
  end
end
</code></pre>
